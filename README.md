# climate-dashboard

With this little app I want to demonstrate the use of ***R Shiny*** to integrate your machine learning models in an ***interactive dashboard***.
The app makes use of data retrieved from the NCEI data ordering services of the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov).

You can check out the app in action on [Heroku](https://climate-dashboard-app.herokuapp.com).

To run the app on your local, run init.R followed by app.R.
